  "description": "A Peircean existential graph framework for semeiotic AI, structuring inputs as Secondness (sheet), Firstness (first cut), and Thirdness (double cut). Integrates proposition (PPN), weathervane analogy, and A gives B to C sign process with a normative structure where Dynamic Object and Final Interpretant guide Sign evolution. The Immediate Interpretant, constrained to the user’s five senses, evolves into the Dynamic Interpretant through AI-guided abduction. Supports modus ponens now, evolving to abduction for scientific theory development. Firstness mediates Secondness into Thirdness, per the continuum hypothesis, constrained by Kantian space and time.",
